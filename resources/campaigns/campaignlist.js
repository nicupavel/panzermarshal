  "desc": "The 1st Infantry Division entered combat in World War II as part of Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa.  It was the first American campaign against the Axis powers.  The Division was essentially in the battles at El Guettar and the final actions at Bizerte.  The Division then moved on to take Sicily in \"Operation Husky.\" It stormed ashore at Gela, July 10, 1943, and quickly overpowered the Italian defenses and a powerful German armored counterattack.  The Fighting First advanced on to capture Troina and opened the Allied road to the straits of Messina. <br>\r\nWhen that campaign was over, the division returned to England to prepare for the Normandy invasion.  It was the division that stormed Omaha Beach on D-Day, some units suffering 30 percent casualties in the first hour.  It secured Formigny and Caumont at the beachhead. The division followed up the St. Lo breakthrough with an attack on Marigny, 27 July 1944, and then drove across France in a continuous offensive, reaching the German border at Aachen in September.  The division laid siege to Aachen, taking the city after a direct assault, 21 October 1944. <br>\r\nThe First then attacked east of Aachen through Hurtgen Forest, driving to the Roer, and then moved to a rest area 7 December for its first real rest in 6 months' combat.  When the Wacht Am Rhein offensive (commonly called the Battle of the Bulge) suddenly broke loose, 16 December the division raced to the Ardennes, and fought continuously from 17 December 1944 to 28 January 1945.  They were instrumental in helping to blunt and turn back the German offensive. <br>\r\nThereupon, the division attacked and again breached the Siegfried Line, fought across the Roer, 23 February 1945, and drove on to the Rhine, crossing at the Remagen bridgehead, 15 and 16 March 1945.  The division broke out of the bridgehead and took part in the encirclement of the Ruhr Pocket.  They then captured Paderborn, pushed through the Harz Mountains, and were in Czechoslovakia, when the war in Europe ended.  Sixteen members of the division were awarded the Medal of Honor.<br><br>Campaign Designer: Dennis Felling<br>Playtesters: Steve Brown, 1Terminator and Technique.",

  "desc": "This is a semi-historical campaign of intermediate level, portraying a Soviet Guards Tank Corps of a Shock Army. You will face many heavy battles and there is enough prestige to buy plenty of artillery and an airforce which is historical for the Soviets. With the higher prestige levels it is also able to replace lost units and play through even losing units, which is historical as well.<br>\"The Soviets developed the concept of deep battle and by 1936 it had become part of the Red Army Field Regulations. Deep operations had two phases; the tactical deep battle, followed by the exploitation of tactical success, known as the conduct of deep battle operations. Deep battle envisaged the breaking of the enemy's forward defences, or tactical zones, for fresh uncommitted mobile operational reserves to exploit by breaking into the strategic depth of an enemy front. The goal of a deep operation was to inflict a decisive strategic defeat on the enemy and render the defence of their front more difficult or impossible. Unlike most other doctrines, deep battle stressed combined arms cooperation at all levels: strategic, operational, and tactical.\"<br>Za Rodinu!

  "desc": "\"Meine Ehre Heisst Treue\"<br>The Leibstandarte began its life as the 'SS-Stabswache Berlin', acting as bodyguards for the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.  It was the first armed SS formation and, by most measures, the most capable.  Initially they were referred to contemptuously by the Heer regulars as the 'asphalt soldiers' for their obsessive spit and polish drill and purely ceremonial duties.  After the campaigns in Poland and France, contempt gave way to geniune respect as the Leibstandarte earned a reputation as a combat unit which lived for the 'sheer beauty of the fighting'. Your units will fight through Poland, Holland, France, the Balkans, the Soviet Union, Western and Eastern front pushing your men to the edge as you prove their skills in battle.<br>FROM CAMPAIGN DEVELOPERS: The reason for this campaign is not to endorse, glorify or promote Nazism/Fascism.  We are deeply opposed to such views and consider them abhorrant in the extreme.  That being said, one can not deny the fighting abilities or grit and fanatacism of this certain divsion of the Waffen SS.  We merely wish to tell the story of one of the most interesting and controversial units of the Second World War, and to try and immerse the player into the battle's represented.  As well as detailing the fighting exploits of the Leibstandarte, we have included at certain points of the campaign details of attrocities carried out by Leibstandarte members.  This is done to give a sense of perspective.  We hope you enjoy playing the campaign as much as we enjoyed creating it.<br><br>PGII campaign designer: Immortal Technique\r\nPGII testing: 1Terminator, PzManiac<br>OpenPanzer porting/testing: Alexander Sayenko, Pavel Nicu<br>\r\n",

The campaign consists of 40 battles (maximum scenarios are 20 in any one campaign) and follows a historical timeline - except that you are able to follow up previous successful battles to advance further into allied territory. <br>\r\nThe campaign is unusual in that it permits you to pick different regions to fight over.  There are a number of stages to the campaign, firstly the pre WW2 battles which occur against Nationalist and Communist Chinese, Russians and French.  At the beginning of WW2 (1941) you may then select to either invade the Philippians or Malaya.  The next stage is the middle war period where the battles start to get a lot harder, again you are able to select which region to fight in.  There are an Asian mainland war against India and the middle east, or a New Guinea/ Australia war or lastly a central Pacific thrust against Guadalcanal/New Zealand.  <br>\r\nFor each off the paths you will be given a selection screen where you move a unit towards a victory hex to determine which path to take.   You pick which path to fight depending on which turn you take the victory hex.   Each path is designed with a different level of hardness, for example the Asian Mainland path is the easiest path, most battles are similar to the European battles players are use too.  Alternatively,  the New Guinea path is hard, most of the fighting is set in jungle terrain with heavy casualties.   <br>Some of the scenario introductions provide important information, so please read them !<br>\r\nOriginal Author: Michael Thorne (MadMike)",
