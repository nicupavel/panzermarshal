Be aware that Rommel troops are very experienced and Rommel is always sly in his engagements, he is not named Desert Fox for nothing ! He might try to lure you away from your objective in the east  at Sbiba city and get you to focus on the northen objective at Thala while he waits for his promised reinforcements. Take great care with his panzer units, these are veteran units and can inflict a lot of losses to your side.<br><br>Good luck, Commander.",
