The situation for Germany was critical - Budapest had fallen after a 51 day seige; Warsaw, Lodz and Krakow had fallen; a Soviet Army was in East Prussia; the Red Army was now a mere 200km from Prague, and worst of all, it had crossed the river Oder, and was only 70km from Berlin.  The I SS Panzer Corps was to be used to rectify this critical situation.<br><br>The Soviets held a considerable bridgehead over the Gran river, north of Eztergom.  This position was seen as a potential assembly area for a possible thrust towards Vienna and as such it had to be elminated before the main offensive - aimed at elimating the Soviet units from the area west of the Danube and north of the Drava rivers and to secure the Nagykanizsa oil deposits - could begin.
