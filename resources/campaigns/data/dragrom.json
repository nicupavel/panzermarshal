The Red Army's 4th Ukrainian Front engaged German 17.

The rapid movement of the Red Army together with inadequate preparation of the defences of Sevastopol made this impossible, and on 9 May 1944, not even one month after the start of the battle, Sevastopol fell.<br>(from en.wikipedia.org )                                                          ",
