  "intro": "Good Morning Comrade General Zhukov.  This is a matter of dire importance.  As you know our beloved Stalingrad has been repeatedly bombed and strafed by the German Luftwaffe.  Our patriotic partisians and snipers have been holding their own, after the subsequent invasion of our beloved city.  The German 6th Army, consisting of Von Paulus & his cronies, and castoffs from the 4th Panzer Division, have besieged the city and are now occupying territory West of the Railway tracks.  I have brought in the finest generals & commanders, and one of the most massive attack forces of history, to oust these Fascist sitters from their entrenchments. <br>           \"NOT ONE STEP BACK!\" proclaims Stalin!<br>Take Stalingrad back now Comrade, but hurry!  Air recon has informed us that the 3rd & 4th Romanian Armies, as well as the Italian 8th Army, are moving in quickly.  There is also the report that the German 48th Panzer Division was sent to reinforce Paulus and his low-lifes.  Good Luck, Comrade General, Comrade Zhukov, in OPERATION URANUS.",
