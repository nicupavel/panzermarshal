The offensive was actually a coordinated invasion of Romania conducted by Red Army's 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts, according to the plans of the Main Command of the Soviet Military (Stavka), the two Soviet fronts would cut-off Axis vital defensive lines in Northern Romania. This then would facilitate a subsequent advance by the Red Army into the entire Balkan region. The Soviet attack commenced with the First Battle of Targu Frumos and Battle of Podu Iloaiei, and culminated with the Second Battle of Targu Frumos. However, Soviet forces failed to overcome German defenses in the region and the offensive operation ultimately failed."
